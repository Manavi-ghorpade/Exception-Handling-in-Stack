The Nausea class is used as the typename when instantiating the stack template.
It is a convenience class because it can be tuned to throw an exception during
any member function call, thereby exercising the exception-handling
capabilities of the stack template.

The Nausea class dynamically allocates and releases its own memory. This ensures
that any failure to properly-release Nausea objects is reported by valgrind.

Each Nausea member function prints an initial to stderr when the function is entered.
A - assignment operator 
C - copy constructor
D - default constructor
X - destructor

A lowercase letter is used if the member function is about to throw an exception.

Each Nausea object has a sequential serial number associated with it. The
serial number prints after the initial. The copy constructor also prints the
serial number of the progenitor/parent from which the copy is made. The
assignment operator also prints the serial number of the object
assigning/changing the invoking object.

Examples:

Examples:
D<03>  Default constructed object 03
C<02-00>  Copy constructed object 02, constructed from object 00
X<10>  Destruction of object 10 
A<12-08> Assignment to object 12 from object 08
d<..>  The lowercase initial (and lack of serial number) indicates that this call will throw an exception
c<..-15>  The lowercase initial (and lack of serial number) indicates that this call will throw an exception
a<12-08> The lowercase initial indicates that this call will throw an exception.

Cleaner output can be generated by suppressing the serial numbers. Define the preprocessor symbol NOIDS to suppress serial numbers (see examples below).

Compiling Examples
------------------

g++ -g -std=c++17 07.cpp Nausea.cpp

Use -I to specify a directory to find include files. For example, if Stack.h is located ion ../somedir:
g++ -g -std=c++17 -I ../somedir 07.cpp Nausea.cpp

Use -DNOIDS for abbreviated error output that suppresses serial number information
g++ -g -std=c++17 -DNOIDS 07.cpp Nausea.cpp

The tests directory contains twelve .cpp files for testing the functionality of the Stack template
class. Twelve .err files contain the expected error output (Nausea output) generated by each test.

To test
-------
method 1:
./a.out 2>my07.err       #redirect stderr (that's what 2> means)  to my07.err
vimdiff 07.err my07.err

method 2:
./a.out 2>&1 | diff 07.err -   #redirect stderr into stdout and pipe that output to the diff function.

To test memory integrity
------------------------
valgrind ./a.out
if you need details on memory leaks
valgrind --leak-check=full ./a.out
